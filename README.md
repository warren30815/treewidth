This repository contains the source code for evaluation of lower and upper bounds of the
treewidth of undirected graphs. It implements a subset of the algorithms
described in [this paper][1] and [this paper][2].

# Notice
Can't run on Mac OS!!!!
Please use Ubuntu

# Compiling

The *Makefile* is in the main folder, so simply execute *make*:

    make clean; make

The output binary is *treedecomp*.

## Dependencies

The code needs the Boost C++ library headers, and specifically the Fibonacci
heap implementation. It assumes the include files are present in
*/usr/local/include*. If your Boost installation is someplace else, you have to
modify the *INCLUDE_DIRS* directive in *Makefile*. The binary library does not
need to be linked.

# Usage

The program expects as input a graph in the following format, one edge per line:
    
    node1 <TAB> node2

where *node1* and *node2* are the endpoints of the edge.

The usage is the following:

    ./treedecomp --upper|lower <graph_file> [<method> [<partial_degree>]]

The parameters are:

* *upper|lower* chooses between upper or lower bounds
* *graph_file* is the name of the graph file
* *method* is the criteria by which each node is chosen next in the
  decomposition sequence, and can have the following values: **0** minimum
  degree (default), **1** minimum fill in, and **2** minimum degree+fill in
  (only for upper bounds)
* *partial_degree* is the maximum degree at which the decomposition will stop;
  in this case, the output files will contain a partial decomposition -- this is
  useful for large graphs (only for upper bounds)
 
## Output

The output will be a file with the name *<graph>.<method>.dec* containing the
tree decomposition.

The format is the following:
    
    <treewidth>
    <number_nodes>
    <node_list>

*treewidth* is a number representing the estimated treewidth, *number_nodes* is
the number of nodes in the tree decomposition of the graph.

*<node_list* contains *number_nodes* blocks representing the tree nodes, each in
the following format:
    
    <node_id>
    <num_nodes>
    <node_list>
    <parent_id>
    <num_children>
    [<child_list>]

*node_id* is the id of the nodes, *num_nodes* is the number of graph nodes in
the tree node, *node_list* is a whitespace delimited list of the nodes,
*parent_id* is the id of the parent of the node in the tree, *num_children* is
the number of child nodes in the tree, and *child_list* is the list of their ids
(if any).
